jurisdiction, heis not set lree by virtue 01 this 1101. It may
also be argued that ‘⁴ 11 in another's territory it is not lawlul
to seize what belongs to the enemy, neither should what¹ has
been seized elsewhere be released there.” Again it is urged
that ‘⁴ traveling is unrestricted ” and “the sea and seashore are
the common property 01 everybody.‘' May the King 01 England
take from his friends, the Dutch, to aid his lriends, the Spanish?
Furthermore the carriage 01 corpses through the territory 01 a
town is expressly permitted under the law.

. The parallel drawn between our case and that 01 the
carriage 01 grain will not bear investigation, because “it does
not concern a city, il grain which has not been grown in its
territory. . . be carried through it.” In transporting dead
bodies through a territory no force is applied, and no wrong
is done to the territory concerned. Above all “these captured
possessions have not yet been made the property 01 the enemy,
and therefore here in the territory 01 the King, who is the
friend 01 both parties, no force should be brought to bear on
the things captured.” “ Foree is brought to bear not only at
the time when a person and when a thing is seized by force,
but then also when they are taken along by force.’' Thus, as
Barbatia says, “a thiel who flees with stolen property to a
church is said to commit a new thelt there because 01 the
newly occurring act 01 stealing.’' “Now it concerns a territory
that there be no one but the ruler 01 the territory to inspire
sear in it.” “It is 01 importance that no captives whatever
be taken, held, or dragged off except by order 01 the ruler
01 the territory, lor these acts derive lrom jurisdiction, and
jurisdiction in the territory 01 our king does not belong to
any foreigner.”

CHAPTER Vll-The opinion of Archidiaconus with reference to a
captive conducted through a church is eaomined.

Against our defense offered in the last chapter the opinion
01 Archidiaconus is cited to the effect that, 11 a person seized
by a bailiff, and being conducted through a church, be taken
therelrom by force, the immunity 01 the church is not violated.
But it is not clear that Archidiaconus held this view, and other
doctors hold the opposite opinion. Itis maintained by our
opponents that the church grants immunity to those who flee
