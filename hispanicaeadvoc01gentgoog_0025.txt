aon Introduction

world constituted a single State, and Roman law was drawn up
ior the citizens ol this one State. But in the modern world there
are many independent sovereignties, and the Law ol Nations
covers questions at issue between the citizens ol these different
States. To this purpose the civil law, in view ot the circum·
stances in which it grew up, is not adopted. The civil law,
commentatore on it and precedents from antiquity are frequently
cited, but rather by way ol confirming or illustrating rules de·
rived lrom contemporary usage. At the same time Gentili stands
between the ancient and the modern world, and his inheritance
lrom the ancient world is evident in many ways. It comes out
in the scholastic form ol his argumentation, which carries us
back to the schools ol the Middle Ages. It appears occa·
sionally in a casuistical argument, as it does in the lancilul
distinction which he tries to make in one passage ¹⁹ between
the meanings of certain words, or in the insistence in another
connection on an exact analogy between physical and legal
processes.²⁰

Great as were his achievements in the field ol international
law, yet in stemming the tide ln England which was setting to·
ward the common law he was doomed to failure. He fought
earnestly in this cause, but it was a lost cause, as he himself seems
to recognize at the close of one ol his speeches recorded in the
Advocatio:

Granted that these pettiloggers of the common law have pushed their way
into marriage cases, into testamentary, ecclesiastical and maritime cases, and
into others oi this sort, which still have always been held to be the peculias
province ol those versed in the civil law, but granted that they have pushed
their way in, simply because those cases had to do with Englishmen, with English
concems‚ with transactione carried on in England; on this account, pray, shall
they rush in and seiae these cases involving ioreigners? Even though this state
oi affairs is in part to be explained by the daily increasing power oi those who
study the common law, still theold landmarlrs should be preserved.²¹

Inone of the two tasks then to which he de'voted himself,
he in part failed, I mean in maintaining the supremacy ol the '
civil law over the common law in regulating those transactione
in which the civil law seemed to him especially ap'plicable. In

the other he succeeded, lor he set forth once ior all in his
