it contains, addressed by the author to the Spanish Ambassador
and to others on certain cases after the decision on them had
been rendered, give it a personal nore which is lacking in other
legal works, and throw some light on contemporary conditions
and practices.

Having been disappointed in his purpose ol publishing the .
collection himself, Alberico instructed his brother, Scipione, to
edit it, and it appeared five years aiter his death. Scipione
appropriately dedicares the work to Don Baltasar de Zitniga,
akinsman oi Don Pedro de Zianiga who, as Spanish Am·
bassador in England, had invited Alberico to act as the advocate
‘ oi Spain. The cases involving the Law oi Nations are collected
in the first book. The second book is oi amore inlormal
character than the first one, and is devoted almost exclusively to
private law, and it is doubtful it many oi the pleas which
it contains are in defense oi Spanish clients.

The contents ol the first book are varied. The presence in it
oi one class oi questions illustrares some oi the important changes
which civilization has undergone since the sixteenth century.
The pirate, the privateer, the Berber and the Turk figure largely
init. What constituted piracy? This was a delicate question
in the days oi Sir Francis Drake and the “ Sea Beggars,” and
the line between piracy and legal warlare was not an easy one
to draw. Ii one bought property directly from pirates, could Ι
he acquire legal ownership oi it? Gentili thought that he could
not, but il one bought through the fiscus oi Barbary property
taken by pirates, the case was more difficult because oi the
quasi-legal standing ol Barbary among the States ol the world.²
So iar as the Turk was concemed, ecclesiastical tradition and
canon law taught that there was a perpetual state oi war be·
tween the believer and the infidel and that the Christian might
have no dealings with the infidel. Gentili boldly challenges
this doctrine in the name oi the Law ot Nations which, as he
says, makes no distinction between nations. He challenges it
in the name ol England, because England has no perpetual

enemies.⁸ But he still retains a vestige oi the old· prejudice
against the Turks in holding that their testimony may not be
taken against Christiana*
