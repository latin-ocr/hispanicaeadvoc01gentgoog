comparable to a home.” ¹² In general he regards the right oi
search at sea as oi doubtful validity, and only to be exercised
oli the coasts oi the prince who owns the worship claiming it.¹³
Another interesting point is raised by the plight oi some English·
men who have been recruited in a neutral country, England, ior
service under the Spanish flag, and captured, while on their
way to join the Spanish forces, by the Dutch. A maritime ques·
tion somewhat analogous to this is whether a vessel is piratical
which is manned by neutrale but is under the command oi a
citizen oi one or two belligerent Powers.²⁴

One oi the cases which he pleads has a double interest ior
us, because it illustrates his method oi argumentation and con·
cerns a subject which is much discussed at the present time. In
a passage in one oi his speeches he tells us that before appearing
in court it was his practice to turn over in his mind everything
which' could be said in support oi his opponente. Indeed the
early part oi most oi his arguments consists of a categorical state·
ment of the case oi the opposite side, supported by the laws and
text-writers who could be cited in its defense. In illustration oi
this characteristic scholastic method, and because oi the present·
day interest oi the issue involved in the suit in question it may be
worth while to give an abstract oi his argument.

An English ship while en route to Constantinople with a
cargo ot general merchandise and powder, “ pulvis tormento·
rios,” as Gentili calls it, was seized by the Sardinians and Maltese

and the cargo confiscated.²⁸ Gentili appeared ior the English
owners to contest the right ol confiscation. Let us present his
conclusions in the same systematic way in which he sets them
iorth in his plea in court. At the outset come the arguments,
marshalled firstly, secondly, and so forth, from the standpoint
oi the Sardinians and Maltese: (r) The civil law, as it stands in
the Code of Justinian‚ prescribes capital punishment ior any·
one who shall furnish the barbarians with munitions oi war.
(2) The canon law imposes excommunication upon Christians ·
who send arms to the Saracens, and the Saracena are amalga-
mated with the Turks. (3) The precedent oi the Hanseatic cities
