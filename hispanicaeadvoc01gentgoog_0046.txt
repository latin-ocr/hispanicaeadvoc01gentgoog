The observations which Gentili makes in the course of his
arguments, on general principles of law and on matters oi
contemporary usage, illustrate his practical wisdom and his
grasp oi the doctrines on which the Law oi Nations rests. For
that reason a lew ot them have been set down here.

The law is intended lor cases in which doubt may arise.
It is to be interpreted on this basis (Bk. Ι, Ch. 1).

A legal enemy is not like a fugitive from justice (Bk. 1,
Chr).

The law governing pirates and wild 'beasts is not applicable
to enemim, i.e., there are laws of war (Bk. Ι, Ch. 4).

A usage does not admit extension in the matter ol place,
⁴persona, situations, or time (Bk. 1, Ch. 4).

War is not a hunt. Political territory is something more
than a private domain (Bk. Ι, Ch. ς). s

The immunity ol a church is opposed to the public inter ·'t
and to the common law (Bk. Ι, Ch. 5).

A neutral is called upon to hand over the spoils ol war to
the victor only after a complete victory (Bk. Ι, Ch. ς).

The jurisdiction ol a church differs from that ol a prince,
because to be exempt from local jurisdiction is not the same
asto be outside a territory (Bk. Ι, Ch. 5).

The doctrine oi continuous sterling is based on the fact
that not only the seizure oi the property ol another but also
the retention ol it is an act ol theit (Bk. I, Ch. 6).

The case oi a man who flees to a church and oi aman
being forcibly taken through itare identical (Bk. Ι, Ch. 7).

“Whatever stands in the original is implied in lull in the
citation'’ (Bk. Ι, Ch. 7).

“The dicta of learned men should be interpreted in

accordance with the laws and the authorities which they have
cited ’² (Bk. Ι, Ch. 7). ’

The last statement of a writer is to be preferred to an
earlier one (Bk. Ι, Ch. 7).
