justified, preference should be given to defense over offense.

and the Tuscans‚ but this does not make the goods taken the
property of the Tuscans‚ because they were not owned by
the sailors, who, in fighting, were not acting under the
instructions of the owners, and under the public laws of war
the sailors may not be regarded as pirates.

CHAPTER XXVIII.-Passaqe·money is owed sortire Turks captured
by the Tuscans on an Enqlish ship.

The passage-money, which the Turlcs were to have paid
for their transportation in the English ship captured by the
Tuscans,² must be paid by the Tuscans‚ because “the victor
takes the place of the vanquished‚'’ and “ claims upon property
go with it when it changes hands.’‘
