14o Introduction

To the old regime belongs also the practice ot granting letters
of marque, a practice which Gentili roundly condemns both in l
his Spanish pleas and in his treatise On the Low ol W or. War ,i
carried on by these means is “ latrocinium verius quom bellum,”⁵
as he puts it, and in taking this position he is in advance of
Grotius who did not tormally disapprove ot letters ot marque.
In this category ot questions which have been settled once tor
all since Gentili's time should probably be placed the important
case with which the book opens. A Spanish vessel, which had
been captured by the Dutch, was being navigated by them
through English waters, when the English authorities took pos·
session ot it, and the case was heard betore the Admiralty. The
questions at issue were fundamental and were much in dispute.
Did the authority of a State extend beyond its coast-line, and,
it it did, to what point did it reach? It the subjecta and the
property ot one belligerent Power were brought by the subjects
ot another belligerent Power within the jurisdiction oi a State
friendly to both, did they regain their original status or not?
These two questions Gentili discusses at great length with much
acumen and learning. Territory, he says, covers water as well
as land, and he quotes without dissent the claim which the Vene-
tians and the Genoese made to jurisdiction up to one hundred
miles from the coast.⁸ ·It is reasonably clear, however, that al·
though the principle was recognized that iurisdiction extended
beyond the coast-line, the limit ot its extent had not been fixed.
On the point oi ownership Gentili maintained that ownership
could not be acquired by a belligerent until the captured prop-
erty had been brought within tortified lineS,⁷ and that further·
more, as soon as the Spanish prisoners and the captured Spanish
property came under the English jurisdiction, Spain automatic·
ally acquired ownership again. In this connection he drew an
interesting analogical argument from the canon law. It a cul-
prit, he says, be taken into a church or a graveyard by a sheriti,
the secular control over him lapses‚ and he may not be taken
therefrom by iorce.⁸ It a place within the territory of a
sovereign power may in this way exercise exclusive jurisdiction

within its confines, much more will the rights of a monarch
over persons and property brought into his dominions cancel
