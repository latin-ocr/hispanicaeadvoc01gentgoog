THE CLASSICS OF INTERNATIONAL LAW

This series, which includes the classic works connected with the history and develop-
mentor international law, was undertaken by the Carnegie institution ol Wasbington
'in 1906, at the suggestion ol Mr. James Brown Scott, then Solicitor lor the Departrnent
oi State, under whose supervision as General Editor the series bas since been published.
On January 1, 1917, the project was transferred to the Carnegie Endowrnent lor Inter-
national Peace and the publication ol the series is being continued by the Endowment's
Division of International Law, ol which the General Editor of the Classica is the
Director.

The republicstion of these classica bas been undertaken principally on account ol
the difficulty of procuring the texts in convenient torm lor scientilic study. The text ol
each author is reproduced photograpbicslly, so as to lay the source belore the reader
without the mistakes which creep into a newly printed text. An introduction is prefixed
to each work, giving the necessary biograpbical details concerning its author and stating
the importante ol the text and its place in international law. Tables ol errata in tbe
original are added when necessary, and notes to clear up doubts and ambiguities or to
correct mistakes in tbe text are supplied. Each ol the Classics is specially edited by an
expert in internetional law and is accompanied by an English version made expressly
lor the series by a competent translator.

The following works bave appeared and are now on sale. The price is indicated
lor each work. They can be obtained by remittance to the publisbers, either the Claren-
don Press, Oxlord, England, or tbe Oxford University Press, American Branch, 35 West
