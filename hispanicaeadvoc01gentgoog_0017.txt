12a Introduction

this conflict there developed between the Spanish and the Dutch
3 great many difficult questions of international law, in which
England as a neutral nation was concerned, and, as Gentili’s
brother Scipione remarks 13 his preface to the Advocatio, James
I “ could 331 help allowing the controversics and quarrels which
these people had referred to him to be settled 13 accordance with
the principles of law and equity.” The cases at issue were heard
by the English Court of Admiralty, and Albcrico Gentili, with
the approval of King James, represented the interests of Spain
at the hearings. He acted 13 11313 capacity from 1605 up to his
death 13 1608. His appointment to this post testifies to the high
esteem 13 which he was held as a jurist and to the reputation
throughout the world which his writings on intemational law
had brought him. Perhaps the opinion which he rendered to
the English court in the case of the Ambassador Mendoza also

The arguments which he made in support of Spanish claims
and the opinions which hc wrote on other matters 31 interna·
tional and of private law were published 13 1113 Hispanico Advo-
catio. Perhaps among legal works of this period this book is
unique. It seems unique 13 two respects. The jurists who pre· .

general subjects or wrote comments and observatione on par·
ticular laws or 33 33333 largely fictitious. In this book, as we
have intimated above, Gentili presents the arguments actually
made before the court and arguments made where important
issues were at stake. Dealing as it does largely with decisions,
